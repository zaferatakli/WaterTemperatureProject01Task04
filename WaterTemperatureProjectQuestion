**Water Temperature Project**

---

### **Problem**
Determine the physical state of water (solid, liquid, or gas) based on its temperature.

---

### **Analysis**
- If the temperature is below 0°C, water is ice, so it is in a solid state.
- If the temperature is above 100°C, water is in a gaseous state.
- Otherwise, water is in a liquid state.

---

### **Design**
1. **Define Variables**:
   - `water_temperature` (integer)

2. **Take Input from the User**:
   - `water_temperature` (integer)

3. **Determine the State of Water**:
   - If `water_temperature` is below 0°C, display: `"Water is in a solid state."`
   - If `water_temperature` is between 0°C and 100°C (inclusive), display: `"Water is in a liquid state."`
   - Otherwise, display: `"Water is in a gaseous state."`

4. **Display Output**:
   - Example Outputs:
     - If `water_temperature` is -5, output: `"Water is in a solid state."`
     - If `water_temperature` is 25, output: `"Water is in a liquid state."`
     - If `water_temperature` is 105, output: `"Water is in a gaseous state."`
